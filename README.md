# Kai Game Engine

This is a Game Engine/framework that I'm currently writing in C++ for my own use (I'm planning to use it for game jams and prototypes). It's still incredibly early in its development process, so it doesn't do anything useful yet. The API is very unstable at the moment and will remain so for quite some time.
